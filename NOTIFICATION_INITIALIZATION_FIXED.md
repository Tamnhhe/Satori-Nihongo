# Notification Service - Fixed Initialization Issue

## üéØ Problem Solved

### Issue:

- App was trying to send notifications immediately on startup
- This caused errors because notification service was initialized multiple times
- Users saw notification errors even when they hadn't logged in yet

### Solution:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Created a single instance of NotificationService
- **Lazy Initialization**: Service only initializes when explicitly called
- **Initialization Guard**: Prevents multiple initializations
- **Login-only Notifications**: Notifications only sent after successful login

## üîß Technical Changes

### 1. **Singleton NotificationService**

```javascript
// Before: Multiple instances created everywhere
const notificationService = new NotificationService();

// After: Single shared instance
import notificationService from "./notification.service";
```

### 2. **Initialization Guard**

```javascript
async initialize() {
  // Only initialize once
  if (this.isInitialized) {
    return this.expoPushToken || 'already-initialized';
  }
  // ... rest of initialization
  this.isInitialized = true;
}
```

### 3. **Safe Notification Sending**

```javascript
async sendWelcomeNotification(userName, totalLessons, completedLessons) {
  // Only send if service is initialized
  if (!this.isInitialized) {
    console.warn('Service not initialized, cannot send notification');
    return false;
  }
  // ... send notification
}
```

## üì± New User Flow

```
App Startup ‚Üí No Notifications (Safe!)
     ‚Üì
User Login Success ‚Üí Initialize NotificationService ‚Üí Send Welcome Notification
     ‚Üì
If Expo Go: Show Alert with Navigation
If Production: Send Real Push Notification
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **No More Startup Errors**: App starts cleanly without notification errors
2. **Single Source of Truth**: One notification service instance across the app
3. **Better Performance**: No redundant initializations
4. **Proper Timing**: Notifications only when user is actually logged in
5. **Error Prevention**: Guards against uninitialized service calls

## üß™ Testing

### Expected Behavior:

1. **App Startup**: Clean, no notification errors in console
2. **Before Login**: No notifications sent
3. **After Login**: Welcome notification appears (Alert in Expo Go, Push in production)
4. **Navigation**: "Xem b√†i h·ªçc" button works correctly

### Test Commands:

```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# Check console - should be clean on startup
# Login - should see welcome notification
# Tap "Xem b√†i h·ªçc" - should navigate to MyLesson tab
```

The notification system is now much more stable and only activates when needed! üöÄ
