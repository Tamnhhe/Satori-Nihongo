# Profile Management Feature Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive profile management system for your React Native application. This feature allows users to view, edit, and manage their personal profile information.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Profile Screen (`profile-screen.js`)

- **Profile Information Display**: Shows user's name, email, phone number, date of birth, and role
- **Profile Completeness Indicator**: Displays a badge when profile is incomplete
- **User Avatar**: Shows initials-based avatar
- **Profile Details Card**: Organized display of all user information
- **Edit Profile Button**: Direct access to edit functionality

### 2. Profile Edit Screen (`profile-edit-screen.js`)

- **Form-based Editing**: Complete form with validation for profile editing
- **Field Validation**:
  - Required fields (First Name, Last Name)
  - Phone number format validation
  - Date validation for date of birth
- **Create/Update Functionality**: Handles both creating new profiles and updating existing ones
- **Success/Error Handling**: User feedback for successful updates or errors
- **Auto-navigation**: Returns to profile screen after successful update

### 3. Navigation Enhancement

- **Profile Stack Navigator** (`profile-stack.js`): Dedicated navigation stack for profile screens
- **Tab Navigator Integration**: Updated to use the profile stack
- **Proper Screen Headers**: Consistent header styling and titles

### 4. Backend Integration Enhancements

- **New API Endpoint**: Added `getUserProfileByUserId` function (ready for backend implementation)
- **Enhanced User Profile Actions**: Added new Redux actions for profile management
- **Saga Integration**: Complete saga implementation for profile operations
- **Fixture API Updates**: Updated mock API for development/testing

## Key Features

### User Experience

1. **View Profile**: Users can see all their profile information in an organized layout
2. **Edit Profile**: Full-featured editing with form validation
3. **Profile Status**: Visual indicator for incomplete profiles
4. **Intuitive Navigation**: Smooth navigation between profile screens

### Technical Features

1. **Redux State Management**: Complete integration with existing Redux setup
2. **Form Validation**: Using Yup for robust form validation
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error display and handling
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Material Design components
5. **TypeScript Ready**: Code structure supports TypeScript migration

```

## Backend Requirements

To fully utilize this implementation, the backend needs to support:

1. **GET /api/user-profiles/by-user/{userId}**: Endpoint to get user profile by user ID
2. **User Profile Model**: Should include fields like firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, dateOfBirth, role
3. **User Relationship**: UserProfile should have a relationship with User entity

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:

1. Navigate to the "Cá nhân" (Profile) tab
2. View your profile information
3. Tap "Chỉnh sửa hồ sơ" to edit your profile
4. Fill in the required information and save

### For Developers:

1. The profile system integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system
2. All Redux patterns follow the existing conventions
3. Form components use the existing form infrastructure
4. Styling follows the Material Design theme

## Customization Options

The implementation is highly customizable:

1. **Form Fields**: Easy to add/remove profile fields by modifying the form schema
2. **Validation Rules**: Customize validation in the Yup schema
3. **Styling**: All styles are in StyleSheet objects for easy customization
4. **Profile Display**: Simple to modify the profile information layout

## Security Considerations

1. **User Isolation**: Users can only view/edit their own profiles
2. **Form Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation
3. **Auth Integration**: Full integration with existing authentication system

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: Implement the required backend endpoints
2. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Avatar Upload**: Consider adding profile picture upload functionality
4. **Advanced Features**: Could add features like profile privacy settings, profile sharing, etc.

## Dependencies Used

- react-native-paper: UI components
- react-navigation: Navigation
- redux: State management
- reduxsauce: Redux helpers
- yup: Form validation
- react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view: Better keyboard handling

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user profile management that can be easily extended and customized based on your specific requirements.
